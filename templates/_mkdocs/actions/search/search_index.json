These are designed solely for SMS/WhatsApp related tasks. Types of Actions Hooks: These are actions that listen for send/receive events from sms/whatsapp. It's like a webhook but it also allows listening from send events and only use GET method. It also allows you to structure the link yourself. Autoreplies: These are actions that automate the task of replying to received messages if a keyword is found in them. You will have to decide on what keywords to use and what reply message you want to send. Use Cases Log the event to your own server if you send or receive a message. Call a remote url if you send or receive a message. Automatically reply if the received message contains a keyword. How It Works In the images below, we explain how the feature works in a simple manner. Hooks Autoreplies Code Example for Hooks <?php // Hooks will always use GET method. // Assuming that you structured your hook link like this: http://someremoteurl.com/test.php?phone={{phone}}&message={{message}}&time={{date.time}} // You should be able to parse the variables like this: $request = $_GET; echo $request[\"phone\"]; echo $request[\"message\"]; echo $request[\"time\"]; // you can do anything with these variables. save to your database or launch an automated task on your end.","title":"Index"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Actions are tools that can also help you automate some tasks, like event listeners on send and receive or autoreply to messages directly.

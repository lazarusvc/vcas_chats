/**
 * Titan Systems API
 * 
 * @desc This endpoint is used for the app builder, it sends your build configurations to the build server when
 * you request for an app build. When your app is finally built, this endpoint is not used anymore unless you
 * build a new app again. We respect your data privacy.
 * 
 * @desc It is also used for the exchange rate API, the rates are from https://openexchangerates.org
 * 
 * @desc It is also used for GeoIP location, normally, a server cannot accurately identify which country 
 * the IP comes from, this is why we create a dedicated service for our customers. 
 * These locations are used to store correct countries in the visitor statistics.
